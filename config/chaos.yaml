# Chaos Engineering Configuration
# Tests system resilience under adverse conditions
#
# Injects:
#   - Network latency (jitter)
#   - Random request failures (drop)

workers: 20
duration: 5m

# Chaos injection settings
jitter: 250ms    # Add 0-250ms random latency to each request
drop: 0.03       # Drop 3% of requests (simulates network issues)

# Thresholds should account for injected failures
criteria:
  http_req_duration:
    - p95<1000    # Higher threshold due to jitter
  http_req_failed:
    - rate<0.10   # Account for 3% dropped + real failures

stop: 30s
