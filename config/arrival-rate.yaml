# Constant Arrival Rate Configuration
# Maintains fixed request rate regardless of response time
#
# Use case: API rate limit testing, SLA verification
# Unlike VU-based testing, this ensures consistent throughput

executor: constant-arrival-rate

# Target: 100 requests per second
rate: 100
time_unit: 1s

# Worker pool to handle the load (should exceed rate / avg_response_time)
workers: 50

criteria:
  http_req_duration:
    - p95<200
    - avg<100
  http_req_failed:
